;;; Commentary:

;; The goal of this package is to allow you to focus in certain parts of your code
;; by exploiting various Emacs' functionality such as indirect buffers and narrowing.
;; The idea is that instead of working in a big buffer, you create *lense buffers* to
;; each relevant parts of the code.

;; There is currently just one main functionality: create an indie buffer from a region.
;; With a couple of variations: create the buffer in other window or in other frame.

;; Basic usage:

;; (require 'indie-buffers)

;; Then you have to set up your keybindings - indie-buffers doesn't presume to
;; know how you'd like them laid out. Here are some examples:

;; When you have an active region that spans multiple lines, the following will
;; create an indie buffer for that region:

;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c i r") 'indie-buffers-region)

;; Similarly you can create the buffer in another window or frame:

;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c i o") 'indie-buffers-region-other-window)
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c i f") 'indie-buffers-region-other-frame)
